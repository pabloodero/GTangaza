  GTangaza workflow
  =================
For an organisation to use GTangaza, they have to sign up and define how they would like 
the dashboard to look like.The definition of the dashboard is done by the dashboard administrator 
who by default is the one who signed up.Other users can also be added as the notice board administrators. 
Definition include creating event categories like Tech Talks, Sports, class lessons, Administration 
notices etc, defining the notice board users by domain, sms configurations etc.
After a noticeboard has been defined by the administrator, the notice board now is ready for use.
Those users allowed to create notices on different event categories can do so. Those who are allowed to
view notices in particular categories can login and view the specific notices.
Each user can add his/her cell phone number in which he/she may receive updates on new notices.
Each user can subscribe to specific category of events such that in case a new event/notice is created 
one will receive update on email and phone if mobile number is provided. Users can decide to unsubscribe 
from the notification service of particular category.
